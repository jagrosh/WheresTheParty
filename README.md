# ðŸŽŠ Where's the Party?

So... where's the party? This bot will help you find out! How? By visualizing where people are posting messages _right now!_ The graph is shown and updated in real-time, so when a user pops up linked to a channel, it means they just sent a message there!

Take a look at a demo of this bot over at **<https://discordparty.herokuapp.com>**, or feel free to host your own copy (see instructions below)!
